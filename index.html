            <p class="two-columns__paragraph_paragraph">Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches you is how to teach yourself. We often just end up drilling specific exercises and mindlessly memorizing information so that when exam time comes around, we pass the test. But once the test is over, that information has outlived its usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information will be retained. In the end, we're really just learning how to pass our tests. </p>
            <p class="two-columns__paragraph_paragraph"><span class="two-columns__paragraph_span-access">Here's the real question:</span> does this approach of repetition and memorization help us truly understand the subject material?

So, what can we do to remedy this?</p>
            <p class="two-columns__paragraph_paragraph">Well, there are various techniques and exercises that can be applied to the educational process to help make it more efficient and engaging. Keep scrolling to uncover some of the secrets of effective learning.</p>
